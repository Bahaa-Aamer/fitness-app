          <div class="text1">
            When I started weight training 24 years ago it was never to be a
            bodybuilder; sure I was always into sports at school back in High
            School, soccer, American football, track and field, but I was the
            skinny kid! I just wanted to gain a little weight and size to help
            with my performance on the field, so my coach encouraged me to lift;
            and the rest they say is history. My mentality is very much to stay
            dedicated to a goal and, if I want something, I will see it through
            to the end.
            <div><br /></div>
            The gym soon became my passion, and along with a new group of
            friends we decided to enter a local bodybuilding competition; just
            for fun to keep us motivated, to train harder, and diet more. Long
            story short, I won! This was so cool especially when I was just a
            novice and a teenager. Competing quickly became my motivation to
            keep training, keep getting better, so I set a goal to stand on
            stage every year. I travelled all over the world winning countless
            shows and over 24 trophies over my 13 years of competing, including
            2 time MuscleMania Pro World Champion and 2 time MuscleMania
            SuperBody Champion.
            <div><br /></div>
            During this time I got a lot of exposure in major fitness magazines,
            photoshoots, speaking at seminars, and in turn trained many
            celebrities and high net worth individuals while mentoring other
            elite trainers in the industry. Another passion was developing;
            educating the masses! I love helping people and sharing my knowledge
            built up over my career, whether it’s in the gym, at a seminar, or
            at an expo. I want to inspire and motivate people of all ages, to
            share the importance of the consistency needed in both training and
            nutrition.
            <div><br /></div>
            I’m extremely humbled to have the level of support from fans and
            followers, and respect as both a bodybuilder, and body composition
            coach, to now be in a position to help guide you to get in to the
            shape of your life.

          <div class="text2">
            Before becoming a bodybuilder and a personal trainer, Lazar Angelov
            played professional basketball for 10 years. He led his team in
            scoring for multiple seasons and was one of the best point guards of
            his class. At the age of 16 he joined the junior national team of
            Bulgaria and played for a couple of teams in the National Basketball
            Association of Bulgaria. At the age of 18 he spent an year and a
            half in the Army, where he found his vocation – bodybuilding. It
            became a constant part of his life and he went on to earn a
            certificate for a personal trainer from the National Sports Academy.
            Lazar started working with people, helping them to reach their
            maximum potential in developing their bodies.
            <div><br /></div>
            He dedicated his life to bodybuilding and since 2006 has been taking
            part in different competitions, while never failing to win at least
            a bronze medal every time. He achieved that despite never taking
            (and never will) steroids. Lazar dominates other bodybuilders with
            balanced physique and incredible definition.
            <div><br /></div>
            He owns some of the best abs in the world. As a personal trainer he
            has been able to transform the bodies of thousands of people and to
            make his motivation and knowledge contagious to them. As a model he
            takes part in a number of music videos and advertisements. His body,
            his ambition and his motivation are inspiration to millions of
            people around the world thanks to his youtube videos. Due to the
            thousands of questions and inquiries about his every day training
            and nutrition he decided to create his personal website –
            lazarangelov.com, where everyone will have the chance to receive
            everything needed for reaching the maximum physical potential
            without using steroids.

        <p class="title">FAQS</p>
        <div class="faqs-text">
          <p>Is this for me?</p>
          <p>
            Yes! My online coaching is for everyone - men, women, beginners and
            advanced.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have designed three coaching packages for you to choose from
            depending on your goal:
          </p>
          <p>
            · The Starter Pack is ideal for beginners and unsure where to start;
          </p>
          <p>· The Mass Gainer to increase muscle mass;</p>
          <p>· The Shred package to reduce body fat and get a lean physique.</p>
          <div><br /></div>
          <div><br /></div>
          <p>Am I ready to start?</p>
          <p>
            If you’re not getting the results you want it’s time to change the
            process; you can’t keep doing the same thing over and over again and
            expect different results. So, if you’re up for putting in the work,
            and being consistent with the training and nutrition plans, you’re
            ready!
          </p>
          <div><br /></div>
          <div><br /></div>
          <p>Is it personalised to me?</p>
          <p>
            Yes your plan will be 100% personalised to you based on your choices
            as part of the registration process. This is not a generic, cookie
            cutter program; you will be asked your nutrition preferences,
            allergies, dislikes etc to ensure you never receive a nutrition plan
            made up foods you don’t like. You will also be asked about any
            injuries you have to ensure your training is specific to your
            abilities.
          </p>
          <div><br /></div>
          <div><br /></div>
          <p>I am vegan/vegetarian; can I still sign up?</p>
          <p>
            Yes. Just make it clear that you have specific dietary requirements
            when asked during the registration process, and your plan will
            accommodate your preferences.
          </p>
          <div><br /></div>
          <div><br /></div>
          <p>How long do the training plans last?</p>
          <p>
            The plans will be updated every month for as long as you’re a paying
            member.
          </p>
          <div><br /></div>
          <div><br /></div>
          <p>Do I really get access to you?</p>
          <p>
            Yes, really! Your plans will be accessible via my exclusive app,
            plus access to the private Facebook group community for extra
            support from me and my team. I will also do regular Facebook Live’s
            to answer any questions you have.

          <div><br /></div>
          <p>How will online coaching help me reach my goals?</p>
          <p>
            Having the additional accountability and support are proven and
            effective ways to reach your goal in the most time efficient way;
            especially when, plateaus kick in, you get frustrated, personal life
            challenges, feeling demotivated – I’ve been through them all! Going
            it alone makes it easier to give up when it gets tough, but I am
            here to keep you motivated in addition to the other members that are
            part of the Facebook Group.
